\section{FinInter}

\begin{definition}\label{List.FinInter}
  \leanok
  \lean{List.FinInter}
  Define the intersection of a list of finite sets indexed by \verb|β|, where each set is given by a function \verb|A : β → Finset α|.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{List.eq_FinInter}
  \lean{List.eq_FinInter}
  \uses{List.FinInter}
  \leanok
  Prove that an element is in the intersection of a non-empty list of finite sets if and only if it is in each of the sets.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  If there's only one element in the list, then it is trival.

  Then we prove by induction.

  Assume the statement hold for a list whose length is $n$, thus an element is in the intersection is in every one of the $n$ sets.

  We add a set $S$ to the beginning of the list. For any element $x$ in the intersection of the $n+1$ sets (which is a subset of the intersection of the previous $n$ sets), it must belongs to the intersection of the previous $n$ sets and $S$. Therefor, $x\in$ the intersection of the $n+1$ sets.

  Thus, the statement holds.

\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{Multiset.FinInter}
  \lean{Multiset.FinInter}
  \uses{List.FinInter,List.eq_FinInter}
  \leanok
  Define the intersection of a multiset of finite sets indexed by \verb|β|, where each set is given by a function \verb|A : β → Finset α|.
\end{definition}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  To prove that if sets \( A \) and \( B \) are equal, then \( A \cup C = B \cup C \), we can approach the proof by showing two inclusions: \( A \cup C \subseteq B \cup C \) and \( B \cup C \subseteq A \cup C \).

  \textbf{1. Show \( A \cup C \subseteq B \cup C \):}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Take any element \( x \in A \cup C \).
    \item By the definition of union, \( x \in A \cup C \) means that \( x \) is either in \( A \) or in \( C \).
    \item If \( x \in A \), and since \( A = B \), it follows that \( x \in B \).
    \item Therefore, \( x \in B \cup C \) because \( x \) is in \( B \) (or in \( C \) if it were in \( C \)).
    \item Hence, every element of \( A \cup C \) is also in \( B \cup C \), which proves \( A \cup C \subseteq B \cup C \).
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{2. Show \( B \cup C \subseteq A \cup C \):}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Take any element \( x \in B \cup C \).
    \item By the definition of union, \( x \in B \cup C \) means that \( x \) is either in \( B \) or in \( C \).
    \item If \( x \in B \), and since \( A = B \), it follows that \( x \in A \).
    \item Therefore, \( x \in A \cup C \) because \( x \) is in \( A \) (or in \( C \) if it were in \( C \)).
    \item Hence, every element of \( B \cup C \) is also in \( A \cup C \), which proves \( B \cup C \subseteq A \cup C \).
  \end{itemize}

  Since we have shown both inclusions, we conclude that \( A \cup C = B \cup C \).
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{Multiset.eq_FinInter}
  \lean{Multiset.eq_FinInter}
  \uses{List.FinInter,List.eq_FinInter,Multiset.FinInter}
  \leanok
  Prove that an element is in the intersection of a multiset of finite sets if and only if it is in each of the sets.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  When talking about the intersection of a multiset of finite sets, we can safely treat the multiset as the list with the same elements in it since order doesn't affect the intersection. So we just need to prove the intersection of a list of finite sets if and only if it is in each of the sets, which is exactly \ref{List.eq_FinInter}.
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{FinInter₀}
  \lean{FinInter₀}
  \uses{Multiset.FinInter}
  \leanok
  Define the intersection of all finite sets indexed by \verb|β|, where each set is given by a function \verb|A : β → Finset α|.
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{eq_FinInter₀}
  \lean{eq_FinInter₀}
  \uses{Multiset.eq_FinInter,FinInter₀}
  \leanok
  Prove that the intersection of all finite sets indexed by \verb|β| is equal to the intersection of their corresponding sets in \verb|Set α|.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  By definition, \ref{FinInter₀} is the intersection of a universal multiset of finite sets.
  
  Two sets $A,B$ are equal means for any $x$, $x\in A$ iff $x\in B$.
  
  Using \ref{Multiset.eq_FinInter}, we have for any $m$ in the universal multiset, $x∈A_m$, and the right side is for any $i$ indexed by $β$, $x∈A_i$, which are equivalent.
  
  But \ref{Multiset.eq_FinInter} requires that the universal multiset is not empty.
  
  By the property of the universal multiset, we have for any $t$ indexed by $β$, $t$ is in the universal multiset.
  
  If the universal multiset is empty, then we have a contradiction.

  Thus, the statement holds.
\end{proof}

\section{MainTheorem}

\begin{lemma}\label{card_eq_sum_char_fun}
  \lean{card_eq_sum_char_fun}
  \uses{toInt,char_fun,card_eq}
  \leanok
  The cardinality of a subset \verb|B| of \verb|A| is equal to the sum of the characteristic function of \verb|B| over \verb|A|.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  The right-hand side of the equation is equivalent to the number of elements in the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$. The left-hand side of the equation represents the number of elements in set $B$. Since $B$ is a subset of $A$, the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is equal to $B$. Therefore, the equality holds.

  Mathematically, this can be stated as:
  \begin{equation*}
  |B| = |A \cap B|
  \end{equation*}
  given that $B \subseteq A$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{card_eq_FinInter}
  \lean{card_eq_FinInter}
  \uses{FinInter₀,eq_FinInter₀,card_eq}
  The cardinality of the intersection of a family of finite sets indexed by \verb|β| is equal to the cardinality of their intersection in \verb|Finset| form.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{card_eq_FinUnion}
  \lean{card_eq_FinUnion}
  \uses{card_eq,FinUnion₀,eq_FinUnion₀}
  The cardinality of the union of a family of finite sets indexed by \verb|β| is equal to the cardinality of their union in \verb|Finset| form.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{char_fun_FinInter}
  \lean{char_fun_FinInter}
  \uses{FinInter₀,eq_FinInter₀,toInt,char_fun}
  \leanok
  The characteristic function of the intersection of a family of finite sets indexed by \verb|β| is equal to the product of their characteristic functions.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  Let $\mathcal{F} = \{A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n\}$ be a collection of sets and let $B = \bigcap_{A \in \mathcal{F}} A$ be the intersection of these sets. Consider the characteristic function $\chi_B(x)$ for any element $x$. We wish to establish the following equivalence:

  \begin{equation*}
  \chi_B(x) = \prod_{A \in \mathcal{F}} \chi_A(x)
  \end{equation*}

  We analyze two cases:

  Case 1: $x$ belongs to the intersection $B$

  \textbf{Left Hand Side (LHS):} $\chi_B(x) = 1$. This condition is equivalent to $x$ belonging to every set $A \in \mathcal{F}$.

  \textbf{Right Hand Side (RHS):} The product becomes $\prod_{A \in \mathcal{F}} \chi_A(x) = \prod_{A \in \mathcal{F}} 1 = 1$. Therefore, LHS = RHS.

  Case 2: $x$ does not belong to the intersection $B$

  \textbf{Left Hand Side (LHS):} $\chi_B(x) = 0$. This is equivalent to the existence of a set $A \in \mathcal{F}$ such that $x \not\in A$.

  \textbf{Right Hand Side (RHS):} There exists an $A \in \mathcal{F}$ for which $\chi_A(x) = 0$. Since the product involves a zero, $\prod_{A \in \mathcal{F}} \chi_A(x) = 0$. Thus, LHS = RHS.
  In conclusion, for any element $x$, we have $\chi_B(x) = \prod_{A \in \mathcal{F}} \chi_A(x)$, which completes the proof.

\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{char_fun_FinUnion}
  \lean{char_fun_FinUnion}
  \uses{FinUnion₀,eq_FinUnion₀,toInt,char_fun}
  The characteristic function of the union of a family of finite sets indexed by \verb|β| is equal to 1 minus the product of 1 minus their characteristic functions.
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}\label{mul_expand₀}
  \lean{mul_expand₀}
  \uses{Finset.powerset₀,mul_expand₁}
  \leanok
  The polynomial expansion of \(1 - \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} (1 - g(i))\).
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  We construct a function \( g' : \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{Z} \). When x < n, g'(x) is defined as g(x), when x >= n ,g'(x) is defined ad 0.

  Since we only use the x < n part of g(x) in the statement, it is obvious that we can change g to g' in the statement.

  Now the statement is completely the same as \ref{mul_expand₁}. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{Principle_of_Inclusion_Exclusion}
  \leanok
  \lean{Principle_of_Inclusion_Exclusion}
  \uses{FinInter₀,FinUnion₀,eq_FinInter₀,eq_FinUnion₀,Finset.powerset₀,char_fun,card_eq_sum_char_fun,char_fun_FinInter,char_fun_FinUnion,card_eq,card_eq_FinInter,card_eq_FinUnion,mul_expand₀}
  The principle of inclusion-exclusion for a finite union of finite sets.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  \leanok
  We want to prove the following equality:

  \[
  \text{card} \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^n A(i) \right) = \sum_{S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}} (-1)^{|S|} \cdot \text{card} \left( \bigcap_{i \in S} A(i) \right).
  \]
  
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Definitions:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Let \( U = \bigcup_{i=1}^n A(i) \) be the union of the sets \( A(i) \).
        \item For any subset \( S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\} \), define \( B_S = \bigcap_{i \in S} A(i) \) as the intersection of the sets \( A(i) \) where \( i \) is in \( S \).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:}
    The inclusion-exclusion principle is used to compute the cardinality of the union of several sets. For the union \( U \), its cardinality can be expressed as:

    \[
    \text{card}(U) = \sum_{S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\}} (-1)^{|S|} \text{card} \left( \bigcap_{i \in S} A(i) \right).
    \]

    This formula is derived from the inclusion-exclusion principle, which adjusts for over-counting by alternately adding and subtracting the sizes of intersections of the sets.

    \item \textbf{Detailed Explanation:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item For each subset \( S \subseteq \{1, \ldots, n\} \), the term \( \text{card} \left( \bigcap_{i \in S} A(i) \right) \) represents the number of elements common to all sets \( A(i) \) where \( i \) is in \( S \).
        \item The inclusion-exclusion principle adds and subtracts these intersections' cardinalities to correct for over-counting elements that appear in multiple intersections.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Verification:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item By applying the principle, we account for all elements in \( U \) by including and excluding intersections of various sizes.
        \item This process ensures that the total count of distinct elements in \( U \) is accurately represented by the sum of the cardinalities of the intersections, adjusted by \( (-1)^{|S|} \) based on the size of \( S \).
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, by the inclusion-exclusion principle, we have verified the given equation.
\end{proof}
